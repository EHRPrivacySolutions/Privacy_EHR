# 🛡️ Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning for Electronic Health Records 🛡️

## 📄 Abstract
This research project aims to address the critical need for privacy in healthcare data, focusing on Electronic Health Records (EHR). We explore the development of a machine learning framework that maintains patient privacy while enabling the advanced analysis of healthcare data.

## 📌 Introduction
EHR systems are invaluable for modern healthcare, but they pose significant privacy risks. Our project seeks to leverage machine learning to improve healthcare outcomes without compromising patient confidentiality.

## ❓ Problem Statement
We identify the challenges EHR systems face in protecting patient privacy and how these challenges hinder the potential benefits of machine learning in healthcare.

## 🎯 Research Objectives
- **To identify and analyze privacy challenges** in existing EHR systems.
- **To develop and implement a robust, privacy-preserving machine learning framework** that employs cutting-edge techniques such as secure multi-party computation, differential privacy, fully homomorphic encryption, and Federated Learning.
- **To evaluate the effectiveness** of the proposed framework in real-world healthcare settings, assessing its impact on patient care and data security.

## 🔍 Methodology
Our approach includes a detailed analysis of EHR data, implementation of privacy-preserving techniques, and the development of machine learning models.
